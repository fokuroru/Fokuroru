.SYNOPSIS
  Interactive release flow: run the tests, frontend build and catalogue gates, merge dev -> main
  (real merge, no squash), tag, generate release notes from git-cliff, and publish a GitHub
  release.

.DESCRIPTION
  Walks through a release step by step, pausing for confirmation before anything that touches
  origin or GitHub:
    1. Run the full test suite (dotnet test on Maki.sln, Release), the frontend build
       (npm run build, which is tsc -b then vite build - the frontend has no test runner, so the
       build is the type-check gate), and the four i18n gates ci.yml runs (extraction committed,
       server keys synced, translations structurally sound, only English eager in the bundle).
       ci.yml only fires on pull requests and pushes to main, so a commit that went straight to
       dev has met none of them before here. Any one failing aborts the release before a tag is
       picked or anything is merged.
    2. Ask which tag this release is (shows the previous tag on main for reference).
    3. Check dev is clean, in sync with origin/dev, and show what's about to ship.
    4. Merge dev into main with a real merge commit (git-cliff needs the granular history -
       a squash merge collapses everything from dev into one commit and breaks range diffs).
    5. Show the merged log, confirm, then push main and create the tag.
    6. Run git-cliff <previous tag>..<new tag> and save it to a temp release-notes file.
    7. Show the notes, confirm, then `gh release create` with that file.
    8. Delete the temp notes file.
    9. Rebase dev onto main so dev carries the merge commit too (a no-op fast-forward here since
       every dev commit is already an ancestor of main's merge commit - no real rewrite happens).

  Every destructive step (merge, push, tag, release) has its own y/N gate. Answering "N" at any
  gate stops the script without pushing/tagging/releasing further than what already happened.

  Step 1 runs against the current checkout (dev, normally), not the merge result. Since
  the merge is a fast-forward-shaped real merge of dev into main, that is the same tree - but if
  main has commits dev doesn't, re-run after merging to be sure.

.PARAMETER Pr
  Number of an already open dev -> main pull request. Step 4 then merges that PR on GitHub
  (`gh pr merge --merge`, still a real merge commit) instead of merging locally, and step 5 tags
  the resulting origin/main without pushing main itself. The PR must be open, base main, head dev,
  and its head must be exactly origin/dev.
