/**
 * The settings page is a set of tabs, and this is the single description of what lives where.
 *
 * It exists as data rather than as JSX because two very different things read it: the page, which
 * renders a tab's entries in order, and the command palette, which searches every entry the caller
 * is allowed to see and deep-links to it. Keeping one list is what stops a card being reachable by
 * search but missing from its tab, or renamed in one place and not the other.
 *
 * `keywords` is deliberately the words a user would actually type: the labels of the controls
 * *inside* the card, not a restatement of its title. Nobody searches for "Downloads" when what they
 * want is the retry cap.
 *
 * Everything a reader sees here is a `MessageDescriptor`, not a string. This module evaluates once,
 * so a rendered string would be stuck in whichever language was active at that moment. Render at
 * the point of use, and note that any `useMemo` doing so **must** list `i18n.locale` in its
 * dependencies: without it the palette keeps matching the previous language's keywords and still
 * appears to work, which is the worst way for this to break.
 *
 * `keywords` is one message per entry holding a comma-separated list, split on render. Fifteen
 * separate messages would hand a translator fifteen disconnected words with no context; one gives
 * them the whole search vocabulary for a card at once, and lets a language add a synonym English
 * has no word for, or drop one that does not apply, without the count having to match.
 *
 * `id` is not translated. It is the anchor and the `s` deep-link parameter.
