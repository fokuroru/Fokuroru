/// <summary>
/// A recommendation candidate from the local MangaBaka dump. Relation fields are set
/// for direct relations of library series (sequel/spin-off/...); the matched lists
/// are set for genre/tag similarity hits. <see cref="BecauseOfTitle"/> is the specific
/// seed whose "feel" most drove a semantic pick (null for genre-only hits). ProviderId is
/// the MangaBaka id and can be fed straight into the existing add-series flow.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="CoverUrl">
/// The full-size cover. Only for surfaces that actually show one that big (the Discover detail
/// card) and for the add-series flow, which downloads it into MediaCover — a poster card must use
/// <see cref="ThumbUrl"/> instead, see there for why.
/// </param>
/// <param name="ThumbUrl">
/// A 167x250 cover from MangaBaka's image proxy (`cover_x250_x1` in the dump), with
/// <see cref="ThumbUrlHiDpi"/> its 334x500 higher-quality twin. Poster cards render into
/// ~150-260 CSS px, and the raw cover behind <see cref="CoverUrl"/> averages ~460x690: a Discover
/// page mounts 240 of them, which is ~590 MB of decoded RGBA against a browser image cache an
/// order of magnitude smaller, so the covers are evicted and re-decoded as you scroll and the page
/// visibly fails to keep up. At x250 the same page is ~44 MB and stays cached. Null only when the
/// dump has no cover at all, in which case the card falls back to <see cref="CoverUrl"/>.
/// </param>
/// <param name="CoRecommended">
/// Readers recommended this one for something in the seed library — the co-recommendation graph
/// vouched for it (<see cref="RecoGraph.RecoGraphScorer"/>), from submitted "if you liked X, try Y"
/// pairs on AniList and MyAnimeList.
/// </param>
/// <param name="TasteMatch">
/// This one sits near the seed library in the BEHAVIOURAL space learned from real reading lists
/// (<c>Maki.Metadata.Taste</c>), rather than near it in what either series says about itself.
/// <para>
/// A third kind of "why", and deliberately not folded into <see cref="CoRead"/> even though both
/// come from the same reading lists. Co-read is a lookup: it fires only for pairs somebody was
/// actually observed to finish together, and is empty for two thirds of the catalogue. This fires
/// wherever both titles have a position at all, which is what lets it explain a pick no pair table
/// has ever seen. Same file, different claim.
/// </para>
/// </param>
/// <param name="CoRead">
/// Readers of the seed library actually finished this one too — the co-read graph vouched for it
/// (<see cref="CoRead.CoReadScorer"/>), from co-occurrence across AniList reading lists.
/// <para>
/// Separate from <see cref="CoRecommended"/> and not merged with it: one is what readers said, the
/// other is what they did, and they disagree far more often than not. Both flags are the only "why"
/// fields not derived from what the series says about itself, which is what lets a pick that reads
/// as unrelated on paper be explained rather than look like a bug — and which of the two vouched
/// for it is a materially different explanation.
/// </para>
/// </param>
/// <param name="FranchiseId">
/// Which same-work component this pick belongs to (<see cref="FranchiseGraph"/>), or null when it
/// is in no franchise, which is most of the catalogue. Never treat a null as a component: two picks
/// that are both "in no franchise" are unrelated, not siblings.
/// <para>
/// Set by <c>RecommendationService</c> from the vector index rather than by the scorers, because it
/// is a presentation concern: the ranking deliberately does not suppress franchise members (see
/// <c>RecommenderTuning.MaxPerFranchise</c> for the measurement), and what the surfaces need is to
/// stop one franchise filling the visible part of a rail.
/// </para>
