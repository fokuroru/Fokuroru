// Admin per *action*, not per class, because a handful of reads here are things the app needs before
// it knows whether the user is an admin: which page "/" resolves to, whether Discover has its local
// database, the reader's display defaults. Those are listed explicitly below and require only a
// signed-in user; every other endpoint — and every write without exception — is admin-only.
//
// Reads matter as much as writes on the rest: these endpoints return the Prowlarr and Kavita API keys,
// the qBittorrent password and the tracker client secrets, all stored in plaintext by design.
//
// "reader", "ui", "discover", "opds" and the per-tracker halves of "scrobble" are per-user, stored in
// UserSettings and read through the scoped IUserSettings — so their writes need no admin policy: a
// caller can only ever change their own. Everything else here describes the deployment (paths,
// Prowlarr/qBittorrent/Kavita connections, source priority, updates) or an app registration shared by
// everyone (a tracker's client id and secret), and stays admin-only.
